# Babel Webpack Build Kit

A starter pack to build JavaScript applications using standards from ES2015, ES2016 & ES2017. It uses `webpack`, `Babel` and `webpack-dev-server` to compile and serve. It is fully compatible with Async/Await as it uses the Babel polyfill. Includes the **EasyHTTP Library** I built as a quick way to get basic HTTP requests going.
